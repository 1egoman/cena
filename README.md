Cena: My take on a grocery list
===

Cena is a grocery list app.

![hero image](readme/hero.png)
What makes it different is the ability
to paste links from wegmans.com (my local supermarket) and it will
scrape the page, providing an image as well as other information for the product.

Another big feature is recipes: Add whatever items you would like to the list,
and create a new recipe with the list contents. A recipe's ingredients can then be
easily added back into the list whenever the user wants to, for example, plan a whole
week's worth of meals.

Even better, the user can choose to print out the list in different categories (the
list sort order section box in the image above). This allows the list to be sorted
based on the layout of the store, for ease of use.

And lastly, because it's web based, your list is always available online to you
on any internet connected device.

Cena is still occasionally worked on by me, but not very often. It's puropse was
for my mom, and unless anyone else suggests anything else, I probably won't add anything
new.
